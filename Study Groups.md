# Which study groups can I join? 
Study groups are track specific. If someone creates a study group for the Full Stack Web Development track, and you don't have access to that track, you can not join it. 

You can RSVP to any study group that was made by someone working on a track you currently have access to, whether or not that track is your current track.
