# What is a study group? 

Study groups are a way for you learn collaboratively with a group of students online. When you join a study group, you’re signing up to be on Learn with the group at a particular time on a particular day. Every study group is associated with particular lessons, units and/or topics that the group wants to focus on. 

For each group, we spin up a private slack channel and include a unique google hangout link if you want to video chat or screenshare. If you’ve RSVP’d before the group starts, you can join the slack channel anytime between 15 minutes before the group starts to when the study group finishes. Join the channel via the study group widget on your [dashboard](https://learn.co), the [study group index page](https://learn.co/study-groups), the study group’s show page, or on any [lesson page](https://learn.co/lessons/current).

24 hours after the study group ends, the private slack channel is automatically destroyed. The groups are meant to be ephemeral. Enjoy them while they're there :). 

# Which study groups can I join? 

Study groups are track specific. So you can RSVP to any study group that was made by someone working on a track you currently have access to, whether or not that track is your current track.

For example, if someone creates a study group for the Full Stack Web Development track, and you don't have access to that track, you cannot join it. If you do have access to the the Full Stack track, you can join it.
