# What is a study group? 

Study groups are a way for you learn collaboratively with a group of students online. When you join a study group, you’re signing up to be on Learn with the group at a particular time on a particular day. 

We spin up a private slack channel for the group, which you can join up to 15 minutes before the group starts. Join the channel via the study group widget on your [dashboard](https://learn.co), the [study group index page](https://learn.co/study-groups), the study group’s show page, or on any [lesson page](https://learn.co/lessons/current).

# Which study groups can I join? 
Study groups are track specific. So you can RSVP to any study group that was made by someone working on a track you currently have access to, whether or not that track is your current track.

For example, if someone creates a study group for the Full Stack Web Development track, and you don't have access to that track, you cannot join it. If you do have access to the the Full Stack track, you can join it.
