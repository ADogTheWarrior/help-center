# What is Teamviewer?

TeamViewer is a popular piece of software used for Internet-based remote access and support. You can think of it as google hangouts with extra functionality that's useful for Learn.

We use it to enable screensharing between you and the Learn team. Sometimes, text isn't the best way to handle a question or have a conversation. So we use TeamViewer as a way for you to share your screen with us and have a real-time conversation about what's happening in your code.

# Installing Teamviewer

If you're coming from an "Ask a Question" screenshare request modal, your download of Teamviewer should have already begun. If not, go to [Teamviewer Download Page](http://www.teamviewer.com/download/) and download it!

Once you have downloaded the .dmg, .exe, or .deb file from Teamviewer, open it up and begin the installation.

Once you complete the installation, you will see another window pop-up like this:

Click Continue and then skip the step to setup Unattended Access (we won't be using that) and then click Finish. Repeat, you shouldn't need to setup an account with Teamviewer to use it on Learn. It's FREE.

Once you've clicked Finish, go back to Learn and now you can launch into screenshares directly from Learn!

NOTE: If your OS is Windows, please restart Chrome after you've completed your Teamviewer.

If you came from an "Ask a Question" screenshare request modal, you should now see a modal like this:
