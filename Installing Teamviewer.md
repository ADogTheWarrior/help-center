# What is Teamviewer?

TeamViewer is a popular piece of software used for Internet-based remote access and support. You can think of it as google hangouts with extra functionality that's useful for Learn.

We use it to enable screensharing between you and the Learn team. Sometimes, text isn't the best way to handle a question or have a conversation. So we use TeamViewer as a way for you to share your screen with us and have a real-time conversation about what's happening in your code.

# How to Install TeamViewer

These instructions assume you're coming from "Ask a Question" on Learn after an Expert requested a screen share session with you. Please see the installation instructions for your operation system.
