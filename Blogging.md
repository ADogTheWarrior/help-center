# How do I get a custom domain through Learn?

You need to be enrolled in our Full Stack Web Development program and have a learn hosted blog. If you fall in this category, go to your Blog Settings page.

# The domain I searched for on Learn says “Unavailable” but I see it available on another domain site?

We will only purchase a custom domain on your behalf if it is a .com, .net, .info, or .org domain under a certain price point.

# Who owns the custom domain?

You do! We’re purchasing the domain on your behalf. Once you confirm the domain you would like, we set up a new account for you with Namecheap. The account information (username and password) will be emailed to you. We register the domain under your new account.

# How long do I have this domain for?

We will pay for the first year of the domain, after that it is up to you to renew. You become the account holder, so all of the information about the domain is available to you through your Namecheap account.

# I didn’t receive my Namecheap account email. What do I do?

Reach out to us at support@flatironschool.com.

# I want to change my custom domain that I created through Learn, how do I do that?

Unfortunately, this is a one time thing and we cannot change the domain.

# I just set up my custom domain and it shows a generic page, what do I do?

Setting up your new domain can take up to 72 hours to process, if after that point you still have issues, reach out to support@flatironschool.com.
