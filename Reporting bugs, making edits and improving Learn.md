Once the curriculum team reviews your open pull request, and if they agree with the change, they will merge it in. You'll get to contribute to the curriculum and pick up some nice open source contribution cred at the same time. Once your change is merged in you will be notified via email. If your change was rejected for one reason, or another, you will also receive an email.

# When should I edit copy in a lesson?

Use this editor whenever you see an issue in the content of the lesson. It could be a misspelled word, or a concept that could use further clarification.

# How do I raise an issue with a lab or lesson?

Click on the three dots at the top of the lesson, and select Raise an Issue from the dropdown menu to open an issue on the canonical github repository for the lesson.

Once you’ve filled out the issue with detailed information, click submit. The curriculum team will be notified that there is an open issue on the lesson’s repository. They may follow up with you on the issue in Github. 

# When should I raise an issue?

Use the Raise an Issue button when there is an issue specific to the lab or lesson. An example would be if there is an issue with the spec file in a lab. This is an issue you can’t fix by editing the content, and it’s not related to the Learn software. The best way to log it is on the actual lesson repository, so all issues related to a lesson are housed in the same location. 

Note: Do not open a Github issue on the lesson repository if you are having a problem with Nitrous or your local environment, or if there is an issue with the Learn software that is not lesson specific. You will not receive assistance for those issues via this avenue. For Nitrous or environment issues, ask a question on Learn. For an issue with the Learn software, use the Report a Bug form.

# How do I report a bug?

To report a bug hover over your avatar in the top right corner and select Report a Bug from the dropdown menu. Be explicit with your bug report. Provide reproduction steps, and as much context as you can. If possible, send a screenshot of the bug.

# When should I report a bug?

Report a bug using this form when there is something going on with the Learn software that is not lesson or environment specific. An example of a well-crafted bug report would be something along the lines of, “Hi Learn! I am unable to open the Ask a Question feature. I am using Google Chrome version 36.0.1985. When I hover my mouse over the button it doesn’t change to the select hand like other buttons on Learn. It also doesn’t change color to indicate the hover is occurring. When I click nothing happens. I looked in the console under dev tools, and I am seeing this error (link to screenshot).”
